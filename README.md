## Source Data
### Landfills
A list of landfills in New York State can be found the the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation.  The .pdf lists generated by the NYS DEC have been converted into semi-usable data via ArchGIS.  This [list of landfills](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=acb6d6a9eca04ac9b3e25b397bc0560b) includes **active MSW landfills**, **industrial and commercial landfills**, **privately owned landfills** and **hazardous waste landfills**.

### Satellite Images
For the project I will be using data from the **Landsat 8** satellite which collects data in the thermal infrared spectrum.  The data can be found on [Glovis](http://glovis.usgs.gov) (does not work on Chrome).  New York City is located in Path/Row ```13/32``` and ```14/32```. 

### Workflow
```landsat-util``` is a great tool for getting and performing basic manipulations on Landsat 8 data.  Install:

```
sudo pip install landsat-util
```

Then you can search for scense by lat/lon or path/row and download scenes. During download you can 1) specify which bands are needed and 2) provide clipping information.  As an example:

```
landsat search -p 013,032
```
