## Source Data
### Landfills
A list of landfills in New York State can be found the the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation.  The .pdf lists generated by the NYS DEC have been converted into semi-usable data via ArchGIS.  This [list of landfills](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=acb6d6a9eca04ac9b3e25b397bc0560b) includes **active MSW landfills**, **industrial and commercial landfills**, **privately owned landfills** and **hazardous waste landfills**.

### Satellite Images
For the project I will be using data from the **Landsat 8** satellite which collects data in the thermal infrared spectrum.  The data can be found on [Glovis](http://glovis.usgs.gov) (does not work on Chrome).  New York City is located in Path/Row ```13/32``` and ```14/32```.
